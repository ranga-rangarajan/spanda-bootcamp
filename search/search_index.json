have formalized the notion that in order for shared data to be maximally useful, they need to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. </li> <li>An essential necessity for achieving these goals is that the data and associated metadata follow a common standard for organization, so that data users can easily understand and reuse the shared data. </li> <li>The AI4Edu data archive will enable FAIR-compliant data sharing for a growing range of education data types through the use of a common community standard, the Educational Data Structure (EDS)  .</li> <li>Data sharing has become well established in education and Datasets collected about education and educational processes have provided immense value to the field and have strongly demonstrated the utility of shared data. </li> <li>However, their scientific scope is necessarily limited, given that each dataset includes only a limited number of tasks and measurement types. </li> <li>Beyond these large focused data sharing projects, there is a \u2018long tail\u2019 of smaller datasets that have been collected in service of specific research questions in education. </li> <li>Making these available is essential to ensure reproducibility as well as to allow aggregation across many different types of measurements in service of novel scientific questions. </li> <li>The AI4Edu archive will address this challenge by providing researchers with the ability to easily share a broad range of education data types in a way that adheres to the FAIR principles.</li> </ul> <p>Core principles of the Data Archive</p> <p>Sharing only upon gaining permissions</p> <ul> <li>There is a range of restrictiveness across data archives with regard to their data use agreements. </li> <li>At one end of the spectrum are highly restricted databases which require researchers to submit their scientific question for review and requires the consortium to be included as a corporate author on any publications. </li> <li>The other pole of restrictiveness  releases data (by default) under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Public Domain Dedication which places no restrictions on who can use the data or what can be done with them. </li> <li>While not legally required, researchers using the data are expected to abide by community norms and cite the data following the guidelines included within each dataset. </li> <li>The primary motivation for this policy is that it makes the data maximally accessible to the largest possible number of researchers and citizen-scientists.</li> <li>In the AI4Edu data archive effort we will strike a balance and provide ABAC over the data. </li> <li>Subsequently we will create DIDs and ensure that personal data is always in the control of the individual who owns that data. </li> </ul> <p>Standards-focused data sharing</p> <ul> <li>To ensure the utility of shared data for the purposes of efficient discovery, reuse, and reproducibility, standards are required for data and metadata organization. </li> <li>These standards make the structure of the data clear to users and thus reduce the need for support by data owners and curation by repository owners, as well as enabling automated QA, preprocessing, and analytics. </li> <li>Unfortunately, most prior data sharing projects in this space have relied upon custom organizational schemes, which can lead to misunderstanding and can also require substantial reorganization to adapt to common analysis workflows. </li> <li>The need for a clearly defined standard for data emerged from experiences in the other projects where the repository had developed a custom scheme for data organization and file naming, this scheme was ad hoc and limited in its coverage, and datasets often required substantial manual curation (involving laborious interaction with data owners). </li> <li>In addition, there was no built in mechanism to directly validate whether a particular dataset met the standard.</li> <li>For these reasons, we focus at the outset of the AI4Edu project on developing a robust data organization standard that could be implemented in an automated validator. </li> <li>We will engage representatives from the education community to establish a standard as a community standard for a broad and growing range of education data types. </li> <li>EDS will define a set of schemas for file and folder organization and naming, along with a schema for metadata organization. </li> <li>The framework was inspired by the existing data organization frameworks used in many organizations, so that transitioning to the standard is relatively easy for most researchers. </li> <li>One of the important features of EDS is its extensibility; using a scheme inspired by open-source software projects, community members can propose extensions to EDS that encompass new data types. </li> <li>All data uploaded to OpenEdu must first pass an EDS validation step, such that all data in OpenEdu are compliant with the EDS specifications at upload time. </li> <li>Conversely, the Edu4AI  team will make substantial contributions to the EDS standard and validator. </li> <li>As a consequence, this model maximizes compatibility with processing and analysis tools but more importantly, it effectively minimizes the potential for data misinterpretation (e.g., when owner and reuser have slightly different definitions of a critical acquisition parameter).

<li>Directional expectation tests, on the other hand, allow us to define a set of perturbations to the input which should have a predictable effect on the model output.</li> <li>For example, if we had a housing price prediction model we might assert:</li> <li>Increasing the number of bathrooms (holding all other features constant) should not cause a drop in price.</li> <li>Lowering the square footage of the house (holding all other features constant) should not cause an increase in price.</li> <li>Let's consider a scenario where a model fails the second test - taking a random row from our validation dataset and decreasing the feature <code>house_sq_ft</code> yields a higher predicted price than the original label. <ul> <li>This is surprising as it doesn't match our intuition, so we decide to look further into it </li> <li>We realize that,_ without having a feature for the house's neighborhood/location, our model has learned that smaller units tend to be more expensive; this is due to the fact that smaller units from our dataset are more prevalent in cities where prices are generally higher. _</li> </ul> </li> <li>In this case, the selection of our dataset has influenced the model's logic in unintended ways - this isn't something we would have been able to identify simply by examining performance on a validation dataset.</li> <li>Minimum Functionality Tests (aka data unit tests)</li> <li>Just as software unit tests aim to isolate and test atomic components in your codebase, data unit tests allow us to quantify model performance for specific cases found in your data.</li> <li>This allows you to identify critical scenarios where prediction errors lead to high consequences. </li> <li>You may also decide to write data unit tests for failure modes that you uncover during error analysis; this allows you to \"automate\" searching for such errors in future models.</li> <li>Take a look at Snorkel (https://www.snorkel.org/) who have introduced a very similar approach through their concept of _slicing functions. _</li> <li>These are programmatic functions which allow us to identify subsets of a dataset which meet certain criteria. </li> <li>For example, you might write a slicing function to identify sentences less than 5 words to evaluate how the model performs on short pieces of text.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#organizing-tests","title":"Organizing

testing is problem-dependent. </li> <li>This is not a template approach but rather a guide to what types of test suites you might want to establish for your application based on your use case.</li> </ul> <p>**Developing, testing, and deploying machine learning models **</p> <p>Combining automated tests and manual validation for effective model testing</p> <ul> <li>To perform ML testing in their projects, this approach involves having a few levels of tests suites, as well as validation:</li> <li>Automated tests for model verification</li> <li>Manual model evaluation and validation.</li> <li>To implement automated tests in their workflow, GitOps can be used. </li> <li>Jenkins runs code quality checks and smoke tests using production-like runs in the test environment. </li> <li>A single pipeline for model code is created where every pull request goes through code reviews and automated unit tests.</li> <li>The pull requests also go through automated smoke tests. </li> <li>The automated test suites\u2019 goal was to make sure tests flagged erroneous code early in the development process.</li> <li>After the automation tests are run and passed by the model pipeline, a domain expert manually reviewed the evaluation metrics to make sure that they made sense, validated them, and marked them ready for deployment.</li> </ul> <p>Automated tests for model verification</p> <p>The workflow for the automated tests will be that whenever someone on the team made a commit, </p> <ul> <li>the smoke test would run to ensure the code worked, </li> <li>then the unit tests would run, making sure that the assertions in the code and data were met. </li> <li>Finally, the integration tests would run to ensure the model works well with other components in the pipeline.</li> </ul> <p>Automated smoke test</p> <ul> <li>Every pull request goes through automated smoke tests where the team trained models and made predictions, running the entire end-to-end pipeline on some small chunk of actual data to ensure the pipeline worked as expected and nothing broke. </li> <li>The right kind of testing for the smoke suite can give any team a chance to understand the quality of their pipeline before deploying it. </li> <li>Running the smoke test suite does not mean the entire pipeline is guaranteed to be fully working because the code passed. </li> <li>The team has to consider the unit test suite to test data and model assumptions.</li> </ul> <p>Automated unit and integration tests</p> <ul> <li>The unit and integration tests the team run will check assertions about the dataset to prevent low-quality data from entering the training pipeline and prevent problems with the data preprocessing code. </li> <li>You could think of these assertions as assumptions the team made about the data. </li> <li>For example, they would expect to see some kind of correlation in the data or see that the model\u2019s prediction bounds are non-negative.</li> <li>Unit testing machine learning code is more challenging than typical software code. </li> <li>Unit testing several aspects of the model code is very difficult for a team. </li> <li>For example, to test accurately, teams would have to train the model, and even with a modest data set, a unit test could take a long time.</li> <li>Furthermore, some of the tests could be erratic and flaky (failed at random). </li> <li>One of the challenges of running the unit tests to assert the data quality is that running these tests on sample datasets was more complex and took way less time than running them on the entire dataset. </li> <li>It was difficult to fix for the team but to address the issues. </li> <li>Some teams opt to eliminate part of the unit tests in favor of smoke tests. </li> <li>The team defines acceptance criteria and their test suite continuously evolves as they experiment by adding new tests, and removing others, gaining more knowledge on what works and what doesn't.</li> <li>The model is trained in a production-like environment on a complete dataset for each new pull request, except that they would adjust the hyperparameters at values that resulted in quick results. Finally, they would monitor the pipeline\u2019s health for any issues and catch them early.</li> </ul> <p> The MLOps toolstack including testing tools</p> <p>Manual model evaluation and validation</p> <ul> <li>Have a human-in-the-loop framework where after training the model, reports are  created with different plots showing results based on the dataset, so the domain experts could review them before the model could be shipped.</li> <li>After training the model, a domain expert generated and reviewed a model quality report. </li> <li>The expert would approve (or deny) the model through a manual auditing process before it could eventually be shipped to production by the team after getting validation and passing all previous tests.</li> </ul> <p>Stress Tests and A/B Tests</p> <ul> <li>Once the pipeline generates the build (a container image), the models are stress-tested in a production-like environment through the release pipelines. </li> <li>Depending on the use case, the team also carried out A/B tests to understand how their models performed in varying conditions before they deployed them, rather than relying purely on offline evaluation metrics. </li> <li>With what they learned from the A/B tests, they knew whether a new model improved a current model and tuned their model to optimize the business metrics better.</li> </ul> <p>Stress testing machine learning models</p> <ul> <li>Testing the model\u2019s performance under extreme workloads is crucial for business applications that typically expect high traffic from users. </li> <li>Therefore, the team performed stress tests to see how responsive and stable the model would be under an increased number of prediction requests at a given time scale. </li> <li>This way, they benchmarked the model\u2019s scalability under load and identified the breaking point of the model. In addition, the test helped them determine if the model\u2019s prediction service meets the required service-level objective (SLO) with uptime or response time metrics.</li> <li>It is worth noting that the point of stress testing the model isn\u2019t so much to see how many inference requests the model could handle as to see what would happen when users exceed such traffic. </li> <li>This way, you can understand the model\u2019s performance problems, including the load time, response time, and other bottlenecks.</li> </ul> <p>Testing model quality after deployment</p> <ul> <li>The goal of the testing production models is to ensure that the deployment of the model is successful and the model works correctly in production together with other services. For this team, testing the inference performance of the model in production was a crucial process for continuously providing business value. </li> <li>In addition, the team tested for data and model drift to make sure models could be monitored and perhaps retrained when such drift was detected. On another note, testing production models can enable teams to perform error analysis on their mission-critical models through manual inspection from domain experts.</li> </ul> <p> - An example of a dashboard showing information on data drift for a machine learning project in Azure ML Studio | Source</p> <p>Drift MonitoringExample:</p> <p>https://github.com/keshavaspanda/drift-monitoring</p> <p>** Behavioral tests for ML (Natural language processing (NLP) and classification tasks)**</p> <ul> <li>Business use case: The transaction metadata product at MonoHQ uses machine learning to classify transaction statements that are helpful for a variety of corporate customer applications such as credit application, asset planning/management, BNPL (buy now pay later), and payment. Based on the narration, the product classifies transactions for thousands of customers into different categories.</li> <li>Before deploying the model, the team conducts a behavioral test. This test consists of 3 elements:</li> <li>Prediction distribution,</li> <li>Failure rate,</li> <li>Latency.</li> <li>If the model passes the three tests, the team lists it for deployment. If the model does not pass the tests, they would have to re-work it until it passes the test. They always ensure that they set a performance threshold as a metric for these tests.</li> <li>They also perform A/B tests on their models to learn what version is better to put into the production environment.</li> </ul> <p>Behavioral tests to check for prediction quality</p> <ul> <li>This test shows how the model responds to inference data, especially NLP models. </li> <li>First, the team runs an invariance test, introducing perturbability to the input data.</li> <li>Next, they check if the slight change in the input affects the model response\u2014its ability to correctly classify the narration for a customer transaction. </li> <li>Essentially, they are trying to answer here: does a minor tweak in the dataset with a similar context produce consistent output?</li> </ul> <p>Performance testing for machine learning models</p> <ul> <li>To test the response time of the model under load, the team configures a testing environment where they would send a lot of traffic to the model service.

It is a declarative statement that describes the property of a dataset and does so in a simple, human-readable language.</li> <li>For example, to assert that the values of the column \u201cnum_complaints\u201d in some table in between one and five, you can write:</li> </ul> <p>expect_column_values_to_be_between(</p> <pre><code>column=\"num_complaints\",\n\nmin_value=1,\n\nmax_value=5,\n</code></pre> <p>)</p> <ul> <li>This statement will validate your data and return a success or a failure result. </li> <li>As we have already mentioned, you do not always control your data but rather passively observe it flowing. It is often the case that an atypical value pops up in your data from time to time without necessarily being a reason for distress. Great - Expectations accommodate this via the \u201cmostly\u201d keyword which allows for describing how often should the expectation be matched.</li> </ul> <p>expect_column_values_to_be_between(</p> <pre><code>column=\"num_complaints\",\n\nmin_value=1,\n\nmax_value=5,\n\nmostly=0.95,\n</code></pre> <p>)</p> <ul> <li>The above statement will return success if at least 95% of \u201cnum_complaints\u201d values are between one and five.</li> <li>In order to understand the data well, it is crucial to have some context about why we expect certain properties from it. </li> <li>We can simply add it by passing the \u201cmeta\u201d  parameter to the expectation with any relevant information about how it came to be. Our colleagues or even our future selves will thank us for it.</li> </ul> <p>expect_column_values_to_be_between(</p> <pre><code>column=\"num_complaints\",\n\nmin_value=1,\n\nmax_value=5,\n\nmostly=0.95,\n\nmeta={\n\n    \u201ccreated_by\u201d: \u201cMichal\u201d,\n\n    \u201ccraeted_on\u201d: \u201c28.03.2022\u201d,\n\n    \u201cnotes\u201d: \u201cnumber of client complaints; more than 5 is unusual\u201d\n\n             \u201cand likely means something broke\u201d,\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p>)</p> <ul> <li>These metadata notes will also form a basis for the data documentation which Great Expectations can just generate out of thin air \u2013 but more on this later!</li> <li>The package contains several dozen expectations to use out of the box, all of them with wordy, human-readable names such as \u201cexpect_column_distinct_values_to_be_in_set\u201d, \u201cexpect_column_sum_to_be_between\u201d, or \u201cexpect_column_kl_divergence_to_be_less_than\u201d. This syntax allows one to clearly state what is expected of the data and why. </li> <li>Some expectations are applicable to column values, others to their aggregate functions or entire density distributions. Naturally, the package also makes it possible to easily create custom expectations for when a tailored solution is needed.</li> <li>Great Expectations works with many different backends. </li> <li>You can evaluate your expectations locally on a Pandas data frame just as easily as on a SQL database (via SQLAlchemy) or on an Apache Spark cluster.</li> <li>So, how do the expectations help to reduce pipeline debt? The answer to this is multifold. </li> <li> <ol> <li>The process of crafting the expectations forces us to sit and ponder about our data: its nature, sources, and what can go wrong with it. This creates a deeper understanding and improves data-related communication within the team.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>By clearly stating what we expect from the data, we can detect any unusual situations such as system outages early on.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>By validating new data against a set of pre-existing expectations we can be sure we don\u2019t feed our machine learning models garbage.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>Having the expectations defined brings us very close to having well-maintained data documentation in place. The list goes on and on.</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>A few specific use cases in which investing time in GE pays back a great deal are:</p> <p>Detecting data drift</p> <ul> <li>A notorious danger to machine learning models deployed in production is data drift. Data drift is a situation when the distribution of model inputs changes. This can happen for a multitude of reasons: data-collecting devices tend to break or have their software updated, which impacts the way data is being recorded. If the data is produced by humans, it is even more volatile as fashions and demographics evolve quickly.</li> <li>Data drift constitutes a serious problem for machine learning models. It can make the decision boundaries learned by the algorithm invalid for the new-regime data, which has a detrimental impact on the model\u2019s performance.</li> <li>Data drift may impact the model\u2019s performance</li> <li>You have collected and cleaned your data, experimented with various machine learning models and data preprocessing variants and fine-tuned your model\u2019s hyperparameters to finally come up with a solution good enough for your problem. </li> <li>Then, you\u2019ve built a robust, automatic data pipeline, wrote an API for the model, put it in a container, and deployed it to the production environment. </li> <li>You even made sure to check that the model runs smoothly and correctly in production. Finally, you're done! Or are you? </li> <li>Not even close. In fact, this is just the beginning of the journey.</li> <li>There are so many things that could go wrong with a machine learning system after it has been deployed to production! </li> <li>Broadly speaking, we can divide all these potential concerns into two buckets: statistical issues and infrastructure issues. </li> <li>The latter comprise things like computing resources and memory (are there enough?), latency (is the model responding quickly enough?), throughput (can we answer all the incoming requests?), and so on. </li> <li>Here, we\u2019ll focus on the former: the statistical issues, which come in two main flavors: data drift and concept drift.</li> <li>Enters data validation. </li> <li>In situations where data drift could be of concern, just create expectations about the model input features that validate their long-term trend, average values, or historic range and volatility. </li> <li>As soon as the world changes and your incoming data starts to look differently, GE will alert you by spitting out an array of failed tests!</li> </ul> <p>Preventing outliers from distorting model outputs</p> <ul> <li>Another threat to models deployed in production, slightly similar to the data drift, are outliers. </li> <li>What happens to a model\u2019s output when it gets an unusual value as input, typically very high or very low? </li> <li>If the model has not seen such an extreme value during training, an honest answer for it would be to say: I don\u2019t know what the prediction should be!</li> <li>Unfortunately, machine learning models are not this honest. Much to the contrary: the model will likely produce some output that will be highly unreliable without any warning.</li> <li>Fortunately, one can easily prevent it with a proper expectations suite! Just set allowed ranges for the model\u2019s input features based on what it has seen in training to make sure you are not making predictions based on outliers.</li> </ul> <p>Preventing pipeline failures from spilling over</p> <ul> <li>Data pipelines do fail sometimes. You might have missed a corner case. Or the power might have gone off for a moment in your server room. </li> <li>Whatever the reason, it happens that a data processing job expecting new files to appear somewhere suddenly finds none.</li> <li>If this makes the code fail, that\u2019s not necessarily bad.  </li> <li>But often it doesn\u2019t: the job succeeds, announcing happily to the downstream systems that your website had 0 visits on the previous day. </li> <li>These data points are then shown on KPI dashboards or even worse, are fed into models that automatically retrain. </li> <li>Q: How do we prevent such a scenario? Expect recent data \u2013 for instance, with a fresh enough timestamp \u2013 to be there.</li> </ul> <p>Detecting harmful biases</p> <ul> <li>Bias in machine learning models is a topic that has seen increasing awareness and interest recently. </li> <li>This is crucial, considering how profoundly the models can impact people\u2019s lives. The open question is how to detect and prevent these biases from doing charm.</li> <li>While by no means do they provide an ultimate answer, Great Expectations can at least help us in detecting dangerous biases. </li> </ul> <p>Fairness</p> <ul> <li>Fairness in machine learning is a vast and complex topic, so let us focus on two small parts of the big picture: the training data that goes into the model, and the predictions produced by it for different test inputs.</li> <li>When it comes to the training data, we want it to be fair and unbiased, whatever that means in our particular case. </li> <li>If the data is about users, for instance, you might want to include users from various geographies in appropriate proportions, matching their global population. Whether or not this is the case can be checked by validating each batch of training data against an appropriate expectations suite before the data is allowed to be used for training.</li> <li>As for the model\u2019s output, we might want it, for instance, to produce the same predictions for both women and men if their remaining characteristics are the same. To ensure this, just test the model on a hold-out test set and run the results against a pre-crafted suite of expectations.</li> </ul> <p>Improving team communication and data understanding.</p> <ul> <li>Finally, we could start off by creating an empty expectations suite, that is: list all the columns, but don\u2019t impose any checks on their values yet. </li> <li>Then, get together people who own the data or the business processes involved and ask them:</li> <li>What is the maximal monthly churn rate that is worrisome? </li> <li>How low does the website stickiness have to fall to trigger an alert? Such conversations can improve the data-related communication between the teams and the understanding of the data themselves in the company</li> </ul> <p>Resources</p> <ul> <li>Great Expectations official documentation. </li> </ul> <p>Testing LLMs</p>"},{"location":"#testing-large-language-models-with-wb-and-giskard","title":"Testing Large Language Models with W&amp;B and Giskard","text":"<ul> <li>Combining W&amp;B with Giskard to deeply understand LLM behavior and avoid common pitfalls like hallucinations and injection attacks</li> <li>According to the Open Worldwide Application Security Project, some of the most critical vulnerabilities that affect LLMs are prompt injection (when LLMs are manipulated to behave as the attacker wishes), sensitive information disclosure (when LLMs inadvertently leak confidential information), and hallucination (when LLMs generate inaccurate or inappropriate content).</li> <li>Giskard's scan feature ensures the identification of these vulnerabilities\u2014and many others. </li> <li>The library generates a comprehensive report which quantifies these into interpretable metrics.
